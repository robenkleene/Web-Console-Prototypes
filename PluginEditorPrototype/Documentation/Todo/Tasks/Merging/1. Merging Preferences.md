# Merging Preferences

* [ ] Merging shared files, `WCLPlugin`, `WCLPluginManager`, `WCLAppDelegate`

## `WCLPlugin`

Make the `WCLPlugin` APIs match.

* [ ] The `WCLPlugin` should have properties that then edit a backing `.plist`
	* Use tests the write this
		* I should be able to set the values of the properties and then inspect the `.plist` and see that the value has changed
		* Make sure it also gets saved to disk

## `WCLPluginManager`

## `WCLAppDelegate`

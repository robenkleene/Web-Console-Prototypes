# After Merging Preferences

* [ ] Remember to transfer over tests
* [ ] Use this method for destination frames

		+ (BOOL)destinationFrame:(NSRect)destinationFrame isValidForWindowFrame:(NSRect)windowFrame

* [ ] Plugin names can't have characters not allowed by the file system, let the file system do validation
* [ ] Review all warnings
	* In `PluginEditorPrototype`
	* In `Web Console`
* [ ] Implement "Choose:" button
	* Don't do this now, it'll be easier to implement when I have access to the file system with real bundles
	* Validation for the "Command" should disallow all characters disallowed in the file system
		* Must be inside the bundle
		* Also implement "Choose" dialog?
		* Should exist on the file system
		* Should be executable
		* Needs a tooltip
* [ ] Implement adding plugins from the file system so that it's added to the `nameToPlugin` dictionary and `WCLPluginArrayController`'s array
	* Write test for WCLPluginViewController
		* If a plugin value changes (i.e., by editing the plist, name for example), the KVO should make the corresponding user interface elements for the selected plugin update. I.e., the selected plugin should always reflect the backing plist, even if the plist if editing manually
* [ ] Additional data fields for plugins from plist: "Created By", "Description", etc...
* [ ] Add validation for command (should be a file on disk)
* [ ] My default new plugin is sometimes getting cleared when running the actual app
	* Next this happens look at the preferences plist
	* Looks like the identifier has been written to another identifier
* [ ] Display bug on preference buttons
* [ ] Later add test that the environment variables are properly passed to the shell script

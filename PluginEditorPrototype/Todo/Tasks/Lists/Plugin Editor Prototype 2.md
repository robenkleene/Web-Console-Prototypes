# Plugin Editor Prototype 2

Instead of merging the `PluginEditorPrototype` into the main project, into may make more sense for me to migrate my PluginEditorPrototype into a version that supports the following:

* Plugins backed by Plists
* Editable vs. un-editable plugins, e.g., (built-in vs. user)
	* How do I construct a binding to determine if a property is editable?

## Todo

* Construct this as a new project or as a branch?

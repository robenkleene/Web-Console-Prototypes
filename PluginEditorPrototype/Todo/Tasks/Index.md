## Todo

* [ ] Create a new project where the only files are the ones that I have to override.
* [ ] Start creating tests for these that are based around actually creating files.

### Integrate New Sample Project back into PluginEditorPrototype

* [ ] Remove all managed object context stuff from the main project
* [ ] Instead make those plugins `plist` based
	* Plugins should not be editable by default
* [ ] Figure out how to managed editable vs. un-editable plugins

## Notes

`WCLPlugins` Backed by Plists.

Maybe I should do this in another prototype project? What would that look like?

What do I do if there isnâ€™t a default new plugin already?

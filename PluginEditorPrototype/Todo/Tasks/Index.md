## Todo

* Start creating `PluginDataController` that implements `NSFilePresenter`
* Make sure the all the `didSet` for plugin setters don't get called during initialization

### Plugin Changes

* [ ] Remove all managed object context stuff from the main project
* [ ] Instead make those plugins `plist` based
	* Plugins should not be editable by default
* [ ] Figure out how to managed editable vs. un-editable plugins
